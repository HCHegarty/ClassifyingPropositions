It is built on top of the [Ray](https://https://ray.io/) framework, which makes it perfect for parallel hyperparameter tuning on multiple GPUs. Make sure to set you runtime to use GPUs when going through this notebook. Since Colab provides us with limited memory and a single GPU, we use a much smaller transformer (tiny-distilroberta), run only 3 samples, and use a perturbation interval of 2 iterations in this notebook. The results in the blog post were obtained with a standard BERT model, 8 samples, perturbation after every iteration, and was run on a AWS p3.16xlarge instance. The exact code used for the blog post is [here](https://https://docs.ray.io/en/master/tune/examples/pbt_transformers.html)\n",

        "We also need to add extra functionality for *checkpointing*. After every epoch of training, we need to save our training state. This is crucial for Population Based Training since it allows us to continue training from where we left off even when hyperparameters are perturbed. The Huggingface Trainer provides functionality to save and load from a checkpoint, but we do have to make some modifications to integrate this with Ray Tune checkpointing and to checkpoint after every epoch. The first step is to subclass the Trainer from the transformers library. Ray Tune provides this [TuneTransformerTrainer](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/tune/examples/pbt_transformers/trainer.py) subclass which we utilize. Take a look at the class- we see that it handles reporting evaluation metrics to Tune, checkpointing everytime evaluate is called, and even a way to pass in custom W&B arguments"

        "Let’s dive deeper into what’s going on here. Initially, tune creates 3 (from num_samples) trials, or instantiations of our training function. Each trial has a hyperparameter configuration provided by config. So we have 3 different executions of transformer fine-tuning, each with different hyperparameters, all running in parallel. However, we also pass in a PBT scheduler, with time_attr set to training_iteration and perturbation_interval set to 2. So, after 2 training iterations, we see PBT come into effect. The bottom 25% of trials according to eval_acc exploit from the top 25% of trials by copying over their model weights and hyperparameters. Then after copying over, we do exploration on these trials, by mutating certain hyperparameters specified by hyperparam_mutations. This is where checkpointing becomes crucial- this process results in a creation of a new trial, so we need checkpointing to continue training where we left off, except with the new hyperparameters. This process continues after each training iteration, and instead of randomly searching across our entire hyperparameter space, we can focus on the best performing trials and do a more fine-grained search in that smaller area."
